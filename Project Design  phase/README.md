Welcome to the Project Design Phase of our project! This stage transforms the proposed idea into a complete system design, defining how the solution functions technically and logically. It outlines the problem-solution alignment, architectural design, and implementation structure.

Contains:

Problem-Solution Fit Template.pdf – explains the alignment between user problems and the proposed ServiceNow-based solution.

Proposed Solution.pdf – describes the overall approach, key features, and expected benefits.

Solution Architecture.pdf – presents the technical design, data flow, and component interactions of the system.
